          Alan Turing's discoveries and inventions saved thousands of lives and
          paved the way for modern computing. Despite this, it has been only
          recently that he has been recognised for his achievements.

          <h3>
            Here's a timeline of Alan Turing life:
          </h3>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>1912 - </strong>Alan Mathison Turing was born in London
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1931 -</strong> Turing goes to study Mathematics at King's
              College, Cambridge.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1936 -</strong> Turing published his paper On Computable
              Numbers and an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem (decision
              problem) in which he outlines the Universal Machine, which later
              became known as the Turing Machine. This was an idealised
              computing device that is capable of performing any mathematical
              computation that can be represented as an algorithm.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1938 -</strong> He received his PhD from Princeton in the
              US; his dissertation was called Systems of Logic Based on Ordinals
              and introduced original logic and relative computing.Turing
              started to work part-time at the Government Code and Cypher
              School.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1939 -</strong> The day after war is declared in September
              1939, Turing arrives at Bletchley Park. There he works with Gordon
              Welchman to develop the Bombe, a device for decrypting the
              messages sent by Germans using their Enigma machines. The Bombe
              built on a machine that the Polish had already made, called the
              Bomba Kryptlogiczna. Turing used statistical techniques to
              optimise the trial of different possibilities in the code-breaking
              process using probability.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1941 -</strong> Turing proposes to his co-worker Joan
              Clarke, a fellow mathematician and cryptanalyst. Shortly after,
              Turing had second thoughts, admitting to his fiancee that he was
              homosexual.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1941 -</strong> Turing and colleagues manage to break the
              more complicated German Naval Enigma system. This is extremely
              helpful for the Allies during the Battle of the Atlantic as it
              could help them avoid the fearsome German U-boats, which had been
              responsible for sinking more than 700 Allied ships with 2.3
              million tons of vital cargo.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1945 -</strong> At the end of World War II, Turing is
              awarded an OBE for his services to his country
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1949 -</strong> Turing became deputy director of the
              Computing Laboratory at Manchester University, working on software
              for one of the earliest stored program computers â€“ the Manchester
              Mark 1. He also explored the problem of artificial intelligence
              and proposed an experiment (in his seminal paper Computing
              Machinery and Intelligence) which became that attempted to define
              a standard for machine intelligence, which would later become
              known as the Turing test.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1952 -</strong> Without a computer powerful enough to
              execute his chess program, Turing played a game in which he
              simulated the computer, taking about half an hour to perform each
              move. The program lost to Turing's colleague Alick Glennie, but
              won against Champernowne's wife.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1952 -</strong> Convicted of gross indecency for his
              relationship with a man. Turing is given the choice of being
              imprisoned or chemically castrated with oestrogen hormone
              injections.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>1954 -</strong> Turing's cleaner finds him dead. It
              appears that Turing poisoned himself using a cyanide-laced apple.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>2013 -</strong> Turing received royal pardon posthumous by
              the Queen.
            </li>
          </ul>

              "As the father of computer science and artificial intelligence, as
              well as a war hero, Alan Turing's contributions were far-ranging
              and path breaking. Turing is a giant on whose shoulders so many
              now stand."
